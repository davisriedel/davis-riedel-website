</h3>
<!-- l. 9 -->
<p class="noindent">
  Open Source Software (OSS) can be developed and published by anyone
  without restrictions. Thus OSS packages are not guaranteed to be benign.
  Nevertheless, developers often include many OSS packages in their projects
  to speed up the development process [<a id="x1-1001"></a><a href="#cite.0@Garrett2019">10</a>, <a id="x1-1002"></a><a href="#cite.0@Gustavsson2020">12</a>]. They take this risk because they
  trust the reputation of the package authors and trust that the community
  will quickly find and fix arising issues [<a href="#cite.0@Garrett2019"
    >10</a
  >]. But the problem is even bigger: The packages one depends on, can
  depend on other packages themselves. This means that by adding a single
  direct dependency, several other packages might be recursively included,
  so-called transitive dependencies. And a project can be infected if just
  one of those packages is malicious. Therefore, as the number of
  dependencies of an average software package is ever-increasing, so is its
  attack surface. By attacking some highly popular packages, one can
  possibly infect more than 100,000 other packages [<a id="x1-1003"></a><a href="#cite.0@Zimmermann2019">34</a>]. Such Software Supply Chain
  Attacks (SCAs) on OSS are increasingly frequent and considered one of the
  greatest cybersecurity risks nowadays [<a id="x1-1004"></a><a href="#cite.0@ENISA2021">6</a>].

  Recently the incidents around the
  <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">npm</span> packages
  <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">colors.js</span>,
  <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">faker.js</span>, and
  <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">node-ipc </span>gained a lot of attention
  because they were each sabotaged by their own maintainer. Hence we
  especially focus on the <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">npm</span> ecosystem,
  around the popular programming language
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">JavaScript</span>. The
  maintainer of <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">colors.js </span>and
  <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">faker.js </span>sabotaged his projects because
  he was frustrated that even big corporations use them without paying
  him [<a id="x1-1005"></a><a href="#cite.0@Sharma2022">30</a>,
  <a id="x1-1006"></a><a href="#cite.0@Tal2022a">32</a>]. Meanwhile, the
  maintainer of <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">node-ipc </span>sabotaged his
  project in such a way, that it would affect users whose geolocation was
  Belarus or Russia, as a protest against the war that Russia is waging in
  Ukraine [<a id="x1-1007"></a><a href="#cite.0@Paganini2022">25</a>,

  In this paper, we first discuss how SCAs work and how effective they can
  be. We analyze which strategies an attacker might take and discuss
  mitigation strategies. Afterward, we analyze the aforementioned incidents
  from a technical perspective. Besides that, we have to acknowledge, that
  developing software is not an ethically neutral practice [<a
    id="x1-1009"
  ></a><a href="#cite.0@Noorman2020">21</a>]—especially not with OSS, as it is
  being developed in socially interacting online communities, like on
  GitHub. Therefore we also want to consider the ethical perspective of SCAs
  and these incidents in particular. As a foundation, we first introduce the
  ethical concepts of
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">trust </span>and
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">responsibility </span>and then
  discuss if maintainers are responsible for the integrity of their open
  source projects and if it is rational to trust OSS, i.e. to trust its
  maintainers to act responsibly. With those arguments, we return to the two
  recent incidents and discuss whether the behavior of these maintainers,
  who were also the attackers, is morally acceptable and what factors might
  have led them to act irresponsibly.

  To understand how OSS can be reused, let us now introduce the basics of
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">dependency </span
  ><span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">governance</span>. OSS
  projects are published as so-called (software-)<span
    class="LinLibertineTB-tlf-t1-x-x-120"
    >packages</span
  >, which contain all the project’s resources, e.g. source code,
  executables, metadata etc. They can be uploaded to a (package-)<span
    class="LinLibertineTB-tlf-t1-x-x-120"
    >registry</span
  >, which is a server that stores packages, or rather multiple versions of
  them. OSS packages are hosted in public registries: Anyone can upload
  their packages to them and download packages from them.
</p>
<!-- l. 21 -->
<p class="indent">
  The packages that a package A directly (re-)uses in its codebase are its
  <span class="LinLibertineTB-tlf-t1-x-x-120">direct dependencies</span>.
  Each of those direct dependencies can have (direct) dependencies itself.
  Therefore we define the
  <span class="LinLibertineTB-tlf-t1-x-x-120">transitive dependencies </span
  >of A as the (direct or transitive) dependencies of the (direct)
  dependencies of A. By recursively traversing the dependencies of each
  dependency, one can obtain the
  <span class="LinLibertineTB-tlf-t1-x-x-120">dependency tree </span>of A.
  We call this process
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">resolving </span>the
  dependencies of A.

  Use of Open Source Software
</h4>
<!-- l. 45 -->
<p class="noindent">
  Initially, OSS was a movement of altruist hackers developing software in
  their free time for the common good [<a id="x1-4001"></a><a href="#cite.0@AndersenGott2012">3</a>]. To this day, many individuals
  support and rely on OSS, but there is also an increasing number of
  companies adopting OSS [<a id="x1-4002"></a><a href="#cite.0@Fuggetta2003">9</a>, <a id="x1-4003"></a><a href="#cite.0@Ladisa2022">17</a>]. Two popular examples of commercial
  OSS adoption are Linux and Apache. They are the de-facto backbone of the
  internet nowadays, with about 65% of all websites running Apache [<a
    href="#cite.0@Fuggetta2003"
    >9</a
  >, <a id="x1-4004"></a><a href="#cite.0@Jesiek2003">15</a>]. But
  companies are not only
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">using</span> OSS, there is
  also an increasing amount of companies “contributing their intellectual
  property for free to the open source community” [<a
    href="#cite.0@AndersenGott2012"
    >3</a
  >]. Moreover, even public institutions and governmental agencies,
  especially in Europe, are increasingly interested in the use of OSS [<a
    href="#cite.0@Fuggetta2003"
    >9</a
  >].
</p>
<!-- l. 47 -->
<p class="indent">
  To further understand the popularity of OSS, let us return to our example:
  The <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">npm</span> registry provides OSS packages
  for nearly every imaginable situation, ranging from small utility packages
  to large frameworks and libraries [<a id="x1-4005"></a><a href="#cite.0@Zimmermann2019">34</a>]. On July 31, 2021 the
  <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">npm</span> registry alone contained over 1.8
  million JavaScript packages, and over 21 million different versions of
  those packages. In 2021 alone almost 4 million new versions and over
  400,000 entirely new packages were published to the
  <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">npm</span> registry [<a id="x1-4006"></a><a href="#cite.0@Sonatype2021">14</a>].

  Dependency Managers and Registries
</h4>
<!-- l. 9 -->
<p class="noindent">
  As we have seen in Section <a href="#x1-30002.1"
    >2.1<!-- tex4ht:ref: sec:oss_fundamentals  --></a
  >, dependency managers make it easy to add OSS dependencies to a project.
  This leads to heavy use of OSS packages even for simple tasks. Especially
  in the <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">npm</span>

  ecosystem, it is quite common to rely on very small packages that just
  perform simple computations, so-called
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">micropackages</span> [<a
    id="x1-7001"
  ></a><a href="#cite.0@Zimmermann2019">34</a>], or to depend on a large library
  and only use a single function from it [<a id="x1-7002"></a><a href="#cite.0@Gustavsson2020">12</a>]. Such dependencies can be caused
  by economic pressure to develop as quickly as possible. Although they may
  have short-term gains, each dependency increases the attack surface of a
  project [<a href="#cite.0@Gustavsson2020">12</a>].
</p>
<!-- l. 11 -->
<p class="indent">
  In 2018, each <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">npm</span> package had on
  average 2.8 direct dependencies. Due to their recursive nature, each
  linear increase in direct dependencies leads to a super-linear increase in
  transitive dependencies [<a id="x1-7003"></a><a href="#cite.0@Zimmermann2019">34</a>]. In 2019, an average
  <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">npm</span> package had about 90 dependencies
  overall (direct and transitive) [<a id="x1-7004"></a><a href="#cite.0@Garrett2019">10</a>].

  Another huge risk is that dependency managers can automatically update the
  dependencies, as described in Section <a href="#x1-30002.1"
    >2.1<!-- tex4ht:ref: sec:oss_fundamentals  --></a
  >. Upon installation of a package, for each dependency, an applicable
  version is resolved according to the version constraints. Thus when
  installing on different machines and/or at different times, different
  versions may be resolved. At first, it may seem more secure to lock all
  dependencies to a specific version, to avoid malicious updates being
  installed unnoticed. But that means updates need to be done manually—if
  forgotten, important vulnerability fixes might not be installed [<a

<p class="indent">
  Furthermore, while <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">npm</span>’s openness is a
  major reason for its popularity and growth, it is also a huge risk. To
  publish a package to the <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">npm</span> registry,
  one only has to create a user account on the
  <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">npm</span> website. There are no restrictions
  or checks. The user who first published a package is automatically a
  maintainer, and can thus upload new versions at any time. Maintainers can
  also add other users as maintainers [<a id="x1-7010"></a><a href="#cite.0@Sejfia2022">29</a>,
  <a href="#cite.0@Zimmermann2019">34</a>].
</p>
<!-- l. 25 -->
<p class="indent">
  Moreover, in the <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">npm</span> registry, it is
  not mandatory to provide a link to the repository, where the source code
  is publicly hosted. Attackers can abuse this to stealthily introduce
  malicious packages or package versions [<a href="#cite.0@Sejfia2022">29</a

  We can conclude that while dependency managers and OSS registries automate

  <span class="titlemark">3.3 </span> <a id="x1-80003.3"></a>Attack
  Strategies
</h4>
<!-- l. 9 -->
<p class="noindent">
  In the following we will outline some relevant attack strategies:
  <a id="x1-8001r1"></a>(1) The attacker creates a
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">new package from scratch</span
  >, that fulfills a real purpose. They advertise it, until it becomes
  popular and is used by a lot of downstream users. Then they publish an
  update including malicious code, that infects those pulling the latest
  version [<a id="x1-8002"></a><a href="#cite.0@Ladisa2022">17</a>].<a
    id="x1-8003r2"
  ></a>
  (2)  The attacker publishes a malicious package that has a similar name to
  a legitimate package, for example by just dropping a hyphen, introducing
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">name confusion</span>. Some
  downstream users then pull the wrong package because they are not sure
  which one is the legitimate one or because of a typing error [<a
    href="#cite.0@Ladisa2022"
    >17</a
  >].<a id="x1-8004r3"></a> (3) The attacker
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">injects malicious </span
  ><span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120"
    >code into an already existing package</span
  >, infecting downstream users who pull the latest update [<a
    href="#cite.0@Ladisa2022"
    >17</a
  >].
</p>
<!-- l. 16 -->
<p class="noindent">
  The last strategy can be very attractive for an attacker because some
  highly popular packages have more than 100,000 other packages depending on
  them [<a href="#cite.0@Zimmermann2019">34</a>]. One can thus reach
  thousands of users of the legitimate package and the packages depending on
  it.
</p>
<!-- l. 18 -->
<p class="indent">
  But this strategy also requires access to the codebase of the legitimate
  package. Some strategies to gain access include:
  <a id="x1-8005r1"></a>(1) becoming a maintainer of the project through
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">social </span
  ><span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">engineering</span> [<a
    id="x1-8006"
  ></a><a href="#cite.0@Ohm2020">23</a>].<a id="x1-8007r2"></a> (2) <span
    class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120"
    >contributing </span
  >code that seemingly solves an issue, but is malicious. This code needs to
  be accepted by a maintainer. One might hide its malicious parts by means
  of <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">obfuscation</span> [<a
    href="#cite.0@Ohm2020"
    >23</a
  >].<a id="x1-8008r3"></a> (3) gaining access to the codebase by
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120"
    >compromising the credentials </span
  >of a maintainer [<a href="#cite.0@Ohm2020">23</a>].
</p>
<!-- l. 25 -->
<p class="indent">
  There are also different strategies, for when the malicious code gets
  executed. <a id="x1-8009r1"></a>(1) Malicious code can be placed in
  so-called
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">install scripts </span>which
  the dependency manager runs during the installation of a package [<a
    href="#cite.0@Ohm2020"
    >23</a
  >]. Thus the attack aims at the developers using the package as a
  dependency.<a id="x1-8010r2"></a> (2) Malicious code can be placed in
  tests. Thus attacking developers running those tests [<a
    href="#cite.0@Ohm2020"
    >23</a
  >].<a id="x1-8011r3"></a> (3) Malicious code can also be placed in the
  regular control flow of the package, and thus is executed at runtime of
  the infected package [<a href="#cite.0@Ohm2020">23</a>]. This attack aims
  at everyone running the package, i.e. end-users and developers.
</p>
<!-- l. 32 -->
<p class="indent">
  Furthermore, malicious code may always be executed
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">unconditionally</span>, or
  only if certain conditions are met.
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">Conditional execution </span
  >can be used to <a id="x1-8012r1"></a>(1) hide the malicious behavior
  e.g. in test environments [<a id="x1-8013"></a><a href="#cite.0@Ohm2020">23</a>]<a id="x1-8014r2"></a> (2) only infect
  specific packages [<a href="#cite.0@Ohm2020">23</a>]<a id="x1-8015r3"></a>
  (3) only run depending on the victim package’s application state [<a

<h4 class="subsectionHead">
  <span class="titlemark">3.4 </span> <a id="x1-90003.4"></a>Mitigation
  Strategies
</h4>
<!-- l. 9 -->
<p class="noindent">
  Now that we understand what SCAs are, we want to analyze a few strategies
  to mitigate such attacks. The first mitigation strategy that one might
  think of—and probably the most effective one—is
  <span class="LinLibertineTB-tlf-t1-x-x-120">manually reviewing </span>the
  source code of each dependency one adds or version one updates to. But due
  to the huge amount of dependencies that an average
  <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">npm</span> package has (cf. Section <a
    href="#x1-70003.2"
    >3.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: sec:role_of_dm  --></a
  >) and due to the frequent release of new updates, this is unfeasible, as
  most of the literature agrees [<a id="x1-9001"></a><a href="#cite.0@Ladisa2022">17</a>, <a id="x1-9002"></a><a href="#cite.0@Sejfia2022">29</a>, <a id="x1-9003"></a><a href="#cite.0@Zimmermann2019">34</a>]. E.g. in 2019 approximately 29
  updates per hour were published on
  <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">npm</span> [<a id="x1-9004"></a><a href="#cite.0@Garrett2019">10</a>]. Hence it is also unrealistic for
  the community to review all packages. Moreover, even if one could
  thoroughly review all packages one depends on, this strategy does not
  provide 100% security, since one can always overlook certain
  vulnerabilities.
</p>
<!-- l. 11 -->
<p class="indent">
  Therefore researchers work on systems that can
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">automatically </span>and
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">efficiently </span>flag
  possibly suspicious packages. They are based on the observation, that
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120"
    >many malicious package versions </span
  ><span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120"
    >use certain functionalities that older, legitimate versions did never
    use</span
  >. An example therefore are native Node.js libraries, which allow access
  to operating system level functionalities such as network or filesystem
  access. Another example is the JavaScript
  <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">eval </span>method, which allows code
  evaluation at runtime. Also, malicious updates often introduce new files,
  dependencies, or install scripts that have not been used before [<a
    href="#cite.0@Garrett2019"
    >10</a
  >]. Garrett et al. [<a href="#cite.0@Garrett2019">10</a>] proposed a
  <span class="LinLibertineTB-tlf-t1-x-x-120"
    >machine-learning-based approach </span
  >to detect such anomalies that suddenly occur from one version to another.
  The algorithm is trained with the version history of several packages, and
  not tailored for each package [<a href="#cite.0@Garrett2019">10</a>].
  Sejfia and Schäfer [<a href="#cite.0@Sejfia2022">29</a>] expand on this
  approach and proposed their system,
  <span class="LinLibertineT-tlf-sc-t1-x-x-120">Amalfi</span>. It also
  considers such anomalies as described above, but also incorporates
  mitigation strategies for the following observations:
  <a id="x1-9005r1"></a>(1) “malicious package versions tend not to have
  their source code publicly available, in order to avoid detection” [<a
    href="#cite.0@Sejfia2022"
    >29</a
  >]<a id="x1-9006r2"></a> (2) “attackers often publish multiple textually
  identical copies of one and the same malicious package under different
  names” [<a href="#cite.0@Sejfia2022">29</a>] Therefore,
  <span class="LinLibertineT-tlf-sc-t1-x-x-120">Amalfi </span>uses
  <a id="x1-9007r1"></a>(1)
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120"
    >machine-learning classifiers</span
  >, trained on known malicious and benign packages [<a
    href="#cite.0@Sejfia2022"
    >29</a
  >]<a id="x1-9008r2"></a>

  (2) a <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">reproducer </span>that
  tries to build a package from its source code [<a
    href="#cite.0@Sejfia2022"
    >29</a
  >]<a id="x1-9009r3"></a> (3) “a
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">clone </span
  ><span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">detector </span>that finds
  (near-)verbatim copies of known malicious packages” [<a
    href="#cite.0@Sejfia2022"
    >29</a
  >] Garrett et al. [<a href="#cite.0@Garrett2019">10</a>] tested their
  approach on 2,288 packages and found that their model reports 539
  suspicious updates per week. They state, that even in the worst case,
  where all reported packages are not malicious, the review effort can be
  reduced by 89% [<a href="#cite.0@Garrett2019">10</a>]. Sejfia and Schäfer
  [<a href="#cite.0@Sejfia2022">29</a>] find that the approach by Garrett et
  al. [<a href="#cite.0@Garrett2019">10</a>] flagged more packages than
  theirs. But one needs to consider that
  <span class="LinLibertineT-tlf-sc-t1-x-x-120">Amalfi </span>has a larger
  scope [<a href="#cite.0@Sejfia2022">29</a>] and they state that Garrett et
  al. [<a href="#cite.0@Garrett2019">10</a>] “did not triage the results in
  detail […]” [<a href="#cite.0@Sejfia2022">29</a>]. They state that
  <span class="LinLibertineT-tlf-sc-t1-x-x-120">Amalfi </span>“can detect a
  significant number of previously unknown malicious packages” [<a
    href="#cite.0@Sejfia2022"
    >29</a
  >].
</p>
<!-- l. 35 -->
<p class="indent">
  In conclusion, one can say that machine-learning-based approaches can
  drastically reduce the number of packages that must be manually reviewed.
  But one has to keep in mind, that these systems do not flag suspicious
  packages with 100% certainty.
</p>
<!-- l. 39 -->
<p class="indent">
  Let us now have a look at another approach. We already observed that many
  malicious packages use operating system level functionalities. Then again
  one can observe that a lot of packages published to
  <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">npm</span> fulfill simple purposes and do not
  require privileges like filesystem or network access [<a id="x1-9010"></a><a href="#cite.0@Ferreira2021">7</a>]. Therefore, Ferreira et al. [<a
    href="#cite.0@Ferreira2021"
    >7</a
  >] “propose a
  <span class="LinLibertineTB-tlf-t1-x-x-120">permission </span
  ><span class="LinLibertineTB-tlf-t1-x-x-120">system </span>that
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">sandboxes </span>packages and
  enforces per-package permissions […]” [<a href="#cite.0@Ferreira2021">7</a
  >], following the
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120"
    >principle of least privilege</span
  >. Such permission systems are e.g. commonly used in mobile apps and web
  browser extensions [<a href="#cite.0@Ferreira2021">7</a>]. The developer
  of a package selects the permissions his package needs “from a small set
  of common and easy to understand permissions” [<a
    href="#cite.0@Ferreira2021"
    >7</a
  >]. Every time a user installs a new package or a package is updated, the
  list of permissions needed by that package is shown to them, and the
  installation or update is only performed if they grant those permissions.
  The system also ensures at runtime, that no package can use
  functionalities for which it lacks permission [<a
    href="#cite.0@Ferreira2021"
    >7</a
  >].
</p>
<!-- l. 43 -->
<p class="indent">
  In their tests, Ferreira et al. [<a href="#cite.0@Ferreira2021">7</a>]
  found that they could protect 31.9% of packages, while the average
  performance overhead of their system is, with much less than 1%,
  negligible [<a href="#cite.0@Ferreira2021">7</a>].

  In this section, we want to discuss what it generally means to be
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">morally responsible</span>.
  The concept of responsibility is central in technology ethics and there
  are several different understandings of it.
</p>
<!-- l. 14 -->
<p class="indent">
  First, we want to differentiate between
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">moral responsibility </span
  >and
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">causal responsibility</span>.
  While moral responsibility is a
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">normative </span>relation,
  causal responsibility merely means causation. One can say “the campfire is
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">responsible </span>for the
  forest fire” [<a id="x1-14001"></a><a href="#cite.0@Grunwald2013">11</a>,
  pp. 38], which only conveys that the campfire caused the forest fire. In
  contrast, moral responsibility “is about human action and its intentions
  and consequences” [<a id="x1-14002"></a><a href="#cite.0@Noorman2020">21</a>]. Since we want to ethically analyze
  the actions of OSS developers in this paper, we will hereinafter only talk
  about moral responsibility and mostly just refer to it as
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">responsibility</span>.
</p>
<!-- l. 19 -->

  Moral responsibility has a
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">prospective </span>and a

  >dimension. Responsibility gets
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">prospectively </span>assigned
  whenever actors have normative expectations towards themselves or other
  morally acting entities. A prospective responsibility thus describes what
  a person must do or fulfill in the future [<a href="#cite.0@Grunwald2013"
    >11</a

  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">retrospectively </span
  >assigned whenever an actor criticizes themselves or another entity for
  their actions, intentions, or neglect. Determining retrospective
  responsibility involves determining who was at fault for an occurrence in
  the past [<a href="#cite.0@Grunwald2013">11</a>,
  <a href="#cite.0@Noorman2020">21</a>]. Both prospective and retrospective
  responsibility is a social relation. It describes which obligations or
  duties someone might expect someone else to fulfill. Through
  responsibility certain behavior can be corrected or encouraged [<a

  <span class="titlemark">5.2 </span> <a id="x1-150005.2"></a>Trust
  Fundamentals
</h4>
<!-- l. 9 -->
<p class="noindent">
  Since the OSS community is fundamentally based on trust, we need to
  discuss what trust philosophically means. First, we need to understand
  that <span class="LinLibertineTBI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">trust </span>and
  <span class="LinLibertineTBI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">trustworthiness </span>are
  not the same. We can trust someone who is not trustworthy or distrust a
  trustworthy person. Therefore trust is an attitude one (the
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">trustor</span>) has towards
  another entity (the
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">trustee</span>).
  Trustworthiness is a property one can have, regardless of being trusted by
  others. Trust, however, requires that the trustor regards the trustee as
  trustworthy [<a id="x1-15001"></a><a href="#cite.0@McLeod2021">20</a>].
</p>
<!-- l. 15 -->
<p class="indent">
  Furthermore, trust is only
  <span class="LinLibertineTBI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">plausible </span>if the
  trustor is able to develop trust and is optimistic that the trustee is
  trustworthy. Trust is
  <span class="LinLibertineTBI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">well-grounded </span>if the
  trustee is in fact trustworthy. However, trust can be
  <span class="LinLibertineTBI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">justified </span>even if the
  trustee is not trustworthy. Trust might be
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">justified</span> because it is
  valuable to trust someone in and of itself [<a href="#cite.0@McLeod2021"
    >20</a
  >].
</p>
<!-- l. 19 -->
<p class="indent">
  The trustor relies on the trustee being competent and motivated to do what
  they are trusted to do.
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">Motives-based theories </span
  >find that trustworthy people are motivated by their own interests to
  maintain the trust they were given. They do so out of self-interest or
  goodwill. Trustworthy people include the interests of the trustor into
  their own. Vice-versa we should only trust people that we can reasonably
  expect to include our interests into their own [<a
    href="#cite.0@McLeod2021"
    >20</a
  >].
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120"
    >Non-motives-based theories </span
  >regard the trustee as a morally responsible person (see Section <a
    href="#x1-140005.1"
    >5.1<!-- tex4ht:ref: sec:responsibility  --></a
  >). Therefore the trustor has not only
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">predictive </span>but also
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">normative</span> expectations
  of the trustee. The trustworthy person can have many different kinds of
  motives “including, among others, goodwill, ‘pride in one’s role’, ‘fear
  of penalties for poor performance’, and ‘an impersonal sense of
  obligation’ ” [<a id="x1-15002"></a><a href="#cite.0@Walker2006">33</a>,
  p. 77] as cited by [<a href="#cite.0@McLeod2021">20</a>].
</p>
<!-- l. 24 -->
<p class="indent">
  While trusting someone, the trustor risks, that the trustee might fail to
  do what they were trusted to do, or intentionally abuse the given trust
  and betray the trustor. The trustor can try to reduce these risks, by
  monitoring the trustee. But the more they do so, the less they trust the
  trustee [<a href="#cite.0@McLeod2021">20</a>].
</p>
<!-- l. 27 -->
<p class="indent">
  Finally one might ask, whether trust can be
  <span class="LinLibertineTBI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">rational</span>. If one tries
  to eliminate the risks that inherently come with trust, it may be rendered
  into mere reliance. Also, the trust might make the trustor resistant to
  evidence against the trustworthiness of the trustee. That would mean trust
  can never be rational, but a counter-example is that we could say it is
  rational to trust emergency room physicians [<a href="#cite.0@McLeod2021"
    >20</a
  >]. Therefore some philosophers define rationality differently in the
  context of trust: Trust can be rationally justified if the belief in
  someone’s trustworthiness can be rationally justified [<a
    href="#cite.0@McLeod2021"
    >20</a
  >]. With this definition, we must ask if it is rational to derive
  someone’s trustworthiness from past experiences, or if one needs evidence
  for it. Gathering evidence might cease the trust of the other person or
  might not be possible at all since we are not able to look into the
  future [<a href="#cite.0@McLeod2021">20</a>].

  One can apply these requirements to responsible software engineering as
  well. According to engineering ethics codes, engineers also have
  responsibilities toward their clients [<a href="#cite.0@Franssen2018">8</a
  >]. Since most OSS developers are unsalaried volunteers [<a
    id="x1-16003"
  ></a><a href="#cite.0@Overney2020">24</a>], one might argue that the users of
  their OSS package must not be equated with clients in the business sense,
  and therefore there does not exist a responsibility towards those users.
</p>
<!-- l. 15 -->
<p class="indent">
  This may hold to some extent. A developer who maintains a OSS package in
  their free time, not receiving major funding, may not be responsible for
  actively maintaining the package, as long as they make it clear to the
  users, that the package is in fact not actively maintained, and thus may
  contain unfixed vulnerabilities. On the other hand, we need to ask if they
  are still responsible for fixing dangerous, known vulnerabilities that
  pose a risk to many dependent systems or even their human users. In line
  with Hans Jonas’ imperative (Proposition <a href="#x1-14003r1"
    >1<!-- tex4ht:ref: prop:hansjonas  --></a
  >), they should be held responsible if their package harms a human being
  due to a vulnerability they could have averted (cf. Section <a
    href="#x1-140005.1"
    >5.1<!-- tex4ht:ref: sec:responsibility  --></a
  >). However, if a developer actively maintains a package, or implies to
  the users of that package, that it is actively maintained, one might argue
  that the aforementioned responsibilities of engineering ethics codes apply
  to them. This would mean that they are then in fact responsible for the
  integrity of their package, and moreover, the users of that package, who
  trust them and thus normatively expect them to act responsibly.
</p>
<!-- l. 19 -->
<p class="indent">
  In the incidents we discussed earlier, the maintainers abused the trust
  they were given by performing a SCA on their own package. That makes one
  wonder why they did not feel the normative, social pressure, posed by
  their users who trust them (according to
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">non-motives-based</span>
  theories, cf. Section <a href="#x1-150005.2"
    >5.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: sec:fundamentals_trust  --></a
  >). First, a OSS developer must be aware, that developing software is not
  an ethically neutral practice [<a id="x1-16004"></a><a href="#cite.0@Noorman2020">21</a>]. Further, “computer technologies can
  obscure the causal connections between a person’s actions and the eventual
  consequences” [<a href="#cite.0@Noorman2020">21</a>]. The consequences
  might unfold some time in the future (<span

  affect users that the OSS developer does not personally or even remotely
  know, due to the
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">anonymity </span>the internet
  provides and due to the possibly huge amount of users. Therefore, the
  sense of responsibility a OSS developer feels might be reduced, since they
  might not fully understand the consequences of their actions [<a
    href="#cite.0@Noorman2020"
    >21</a
  >]. It is also important to consider that the actions of a OSS developer
  might be influenced by “hierarchical or market constraints” [<a
    href="#cite.0@Noorman2020"
    >21</a
  >] or by “economic or time pressures” [<a id="x1-16005"></a><a href="#cite.0@Bellovin2022">5</a>]. This might lead to laxity or acting
  irresponsibly.

  <span class="titlemark">5.4 </span> <a id="x1-170005.4"></a>Trust in and
  Trustworthiness of Open Source Software
</h4>
<!-- l. 9 -->
<p class="noindent">
  As we have seen in Section <a href="#x1-40002.2"
    >2.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: sec:oss_adoption  --></a
  >, many individuals and companies rely on OSS and even institutions
  increasingly adopt it. Descriptively, this means that they trust OSS,
  implying that OSS is in fact not only widely used but also widely trusted.
  In Section <a href="#x1-150005.2"
    >5.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: sec:fundamentals_trust  --></a
  >
  we concluded that the trustor, in this case, the OSS users, must believe
  the trustee, in this case, OSS, to be trustworthy. In the following, we
  want to discuss if it is rational to trust OSS.
</p>
<!-- l. 13 -->
<p class="indent">
  One can say that trust in OSS is
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">well-grounded </span>if we can
  expect it to be secure. People that advocate for the secureness of OSS
  often state the
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">Principle of Many Eyes</span>,
  also referred to as
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">Linus’s Law</span>: “Given
  enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow” [<a id="x1-17001"></a><a href="#cite.0@Raymond1999">26</a>]. This means that the more developers
  read the source code of a package, the more secure it gets because each
  bug will be spotted by at least one developer. If Linus’s Law was indeed
  true, OSS would be invulnerable, because the community would over time
  spot all bugs and vulnerabilities [<a id="x1-17002"></a><a href="#cite.0@Hissam2002">13</a>]. But we can observe that OSS packages
  are still vulnerable [<a id="x1-17003"></a><a href="#cite.0@Sonatype2021">14</a>, <a id="x1-17004"></a><a href="#cite.0@Ohm2020">23</a>], e.g. up till July 31, 2021 2.2% of
  <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">npm</span> package versions contained known
  vulnerabilities [<a href="#cite.0@Sonatype2021">14</a>]. One reason for
  this is that OSS packages are not static but constantly evolving and
  getting new features. Another reason might be that not all contributors
  have the required competence to spot certain vulnerabilities. Also, some
  people might be discouraged from contributing for various reasons, like
  lacking time or funding [<a href="#cite.0@Hissam2002">13</a>]. So we can
  conclude, that trust in OSS is
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">not </span
  ><span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">well-grounded</span>.
</p>
<!-- l. 16 -->
<p class="indent">
  We also need to consider, that trusting a OSS package in fact means
  trusting its contributors, and especially its maintainers. Trusting OSS
  can therefore only be
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">plausible </span>and
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">justified </span>if one can
  rationally expect its developers to act responsibly. We could argue that
  most maintainers have an interest of their own in maintaining a legitimate
  package. Therefore
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">motives-based </span
  ><span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">theories </span>would find
  them to be trustworthy (cf. Section <a href="#x1-150005.2"
    >5.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: sec:fundamentals_trust  --></a
  >). We can also argue that since OSS is often developed in a community
  socially interacting with one another (remotely), the maintainers and
  contributors are subject to
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">normative expectations </span
  >as outlined in Section <a href="#x1-150005.2"
    >5.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: sec:fundamentals_trust  --></a
  >. Therefore
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120"
    >non-motives-based theories </span
  >would also find OSS to be trustworthy (cf. Section <a href="#x1-150005.2"
    >5.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: sec:fundamentals_trust  --></a
  >).
</p>
<!-- l. 19 -->
<p class="indent">
  On the other hand, we saw in the previous Section <a href="#x1-160005.3"
    >5.3<!-- tex4ht:ref: sec:responsibility_oss_devs  --></a
  >
  that there are several reasons why a developer might not act responsibly,
  and thus might not be trustworthy. So one might be optimistic that the
  maintainers of a OSS package act responsibly and thus are trustworthy,
  therefore making it
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">plausible </span>to trust the
  package. But it can not always be
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">justified </span>to trust a
  package, especially if one does so blindly. In general, one might say that
  it can be <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">rational </span>to
  trust OSS as a whole, but one should thoroughly consider for each
  individual package if one can optimistically expect it to be trustworthy.

  Although OSS increasingly receives commercial adoption (cf. Section <a
    href="#x1-40002.2"
    >2.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: sec:oss_adoption  --></a
  >), it is often still developed by volunteers who do not receive any
  compensation [<a id="x1-19004"></a><a href="#cite.0@Overney2020">24</a>].
  Such volunteers “increasingly report stress and even burnout” [<a
    href="#cite.0@Overney2020"
    >24</a
  >]. Marak’s complaint in 2020 and the way he mocked his community in the
  days following the incident are hints of him being stressed and frustrated
  due to the lack of compensation. One contributor replied to Marak, that he
  is harming other OSS developers with his actions, rather than only the big
  corporations. The internet may have blurred his sense of whom he hurt with
  his behavior, as explained in Section <a href="#x1-160005.3"
    >5.3<!-- tex4ht:ref: sec:responsibility_oss_devs  --></a
  >.
</p>
<!-- l. 24 -->
<p class="indent">
  But we need to classify these two incidents separately. That Marak removed
  all source code from <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">faker.js </span>is
  arguably
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">morally acceptable</span>,
  since it raised awareness of his situation without harming others
  (cf. Section <a href="#x1-110004.1"
    >4.1<!-- tex4ht:ref: sec:faker_colors  --></a
  >), and thus is in line with Hans Jonas’ imperative (Proposition <a
    href="#x1-14003r1"
    >1<!-- tex4ht:ref: prop:hansjonas  --></a
  >) and engineering ethics codes (Proposition <a href="#x1-16001r2"
    >2<!-- tex4ht:ref: prop:engineering_ethics_codes  --></a
  >). The attack on <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">colors.js </span>on the
  other hand is
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">not morally acceptable</span>.
  While the circumstances that lead Marak to perform the attack are quite
  relatable, they do not justify it, e.g. the infinite loop in
  <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">colors.js</span>, could have potentially
  harmed systems belonging to critical infrastructure, and thus harm other
  people. This attack is thus morally unacceptable according to
  Propositions <a href="#x1-14003r1"
    >1<!-- tex4ht:ref: prop:hansjonas  --></a
  >
  and <a href="#x1-16001r2"
    >2<!-- tex4ht:ref: prop:engineering_ethics_codes  --></a
  >. Furthermore, mocking the people who trusted him, is not morally
  acceptable. Marak could have just stopped working on both packages and
  informed its users, that they are no longer maintained.

<p class="noindent">
  Shortly after the maintainer of
  <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">node-ipc</span>, RIAEvangelist, added the
  <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">peacenotwar </span>package as a dependency
  (cf. Section <a href="#x1-120004.2"
    >4.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: sec:node-ipc  --></a
  >), a contributor opened an issue on the GitHub page of
  <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">node-ipc</span>, asking RIAEvangelist to
  “Remove the ‘peacenotwar’ module” [<a id="x1-20001"></a><a href="#cite.0@NodeIpcIssue2022">27</a>], further stating “Don’t get me
  wrong, I’m against all forms of war, but sabotaging people’s dependencies
  is not the way to protest” [<a href="#cite.0@NodeIpcIssue2022">27</a>].
  This is a hint that RIAEvangelist did not fulfill the responsibilities his
  community normatively expected from him. RIAEvangelist responds, trying to
  justify his actions: “You are free to lock your dependency to a version
  that does not include this until something happens with the war, like it
  turns into WWIII and more of us wish that we had done something about it,
  or ends and this gets removed” [<a href="#cite.0@NodeIpcIssue2022">27</a
  >]. He later says: “I’m going to tag the piece not war module as
  protestware just to make it explicitly clear that that’s what it is” [<a
    href="#cite.0@NodeIpcIssue2022"
    >27</a
  >].
</p>
<!-- l. 11 -->
<p class="indent">
  That RIAEvangelist published the
  <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">peacenotwar </span>package can be morally
  acceptable, since he clearly stated in the package’s description how the
  package will behave (cf. Section <a href="#x1-120004.2"
    >4.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: sec:node-ipc  --></a
  >). However, adding this package as a dependency to
  <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">node-ipc</span>, without immediately
  indicating it, might be considered morally wrong, since this led to the
  malicious <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">peacenotwar </span>package infecting
  users of <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">node-ipc </span>without them knowing
  it. Furthermore he programmed
  <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">node-ipc </span>to sabotage the users’ files,
  which is a violation of the users’ privacy and security, and thus morally
  unacceptable.
</p>
<!-- l. 13 -->
<p class="indent">
  We see that in RIAEvangelist’s view, the protest against the Russian
  invasion of Ukraine was morally more valuable than retaining the trust of
  his OSS community. But one must ask if there could not have been a better
  way to protest, as the contributor who initially commented suggested.
  RIAEvangelist could, for example, have just programmed the package to
  print a protest message to the console (which he did, cf. Section <a
    href="#x1-120004.2"
    >4.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: sec:node-ipc  --></a
  >), without sabotaging the users’ files. One could say while trying to act
  especially exemplary by protesting, he in fact acted morally wrong and
  lost the trust of many people.

<h3 class="sectionHead">
  <span class="titlemark">7 </span> <a id="x1-210007"></a>What We Must Learn
</h3>
<!-- l. 9 -->
<p class="noindent">
  We argued, that it might be plausible to trust OSS, but one cannot do so
  blindly (c.f. Section <a href="#x1-130005"
    >5<!-- tex4ht:ref: sec:trust_responsibility  --></a
  >). The increasing spread of SCAs should be a warning sign, prompting us
  to employ mitigation strategies, as outlined in Section <a
    href="#x1-90003.4"
    >3.4<!-- tex4ht:ref: sec:mitigation_strategies  --></a
  >. Furthermore, although software reuse is a good practice, one might also
  ask oneself if it is really necessary to introduce a new OSS dependency
  even for simple tasks, as this might also increase the attack surface of
  the own software. And one should critically think about the usage of the
  auto-update functionalities of dependency managers.
</p>
<!-- l. 12 -->
<p class="indent">
  Besides those rather technical strategies, we should also try to prevent
  SCAs before they even were performed. The fact that in the incidents we
  discussed, the attacker was the maintainer of the package themself should
  raise our awareness of the circumstances that led them to their
  irresponsible behavior. We should ask ourselves, how we as end users might
  be responsible as well, e.g. for taking advantage of OSS without even
  considering a donation.

<p class="noindent">
  We saw that SCAs are a major cybersecurity threat nowadays [<a
    id="x1-23001"
  ></a><a href="#cite.0@ENISA2021">6</a>]. Due to the many dependencies, an
  average OSS package has, an attack on a single package can spread to
  thousands of other packages that directly or transitively depend on it.
  Dependency managers play a significant role in such attacks, as they make
  it easy to include many (micro-)packages and can automatically download
  updates of packages, which could potentially be malicious [<a
    id="x1-23002"
  ></a><a href="#cite.0@Garrett2019">10</a>, <a id="x1-23003"></a><a href="#cite.0@Gustavsson2020">12</a>, <a id="x1-23004"></a><a href="#cite.0@Zimmermann2019">34</a>]. We have seen, that it is
  impractical to manually review all packages and each update of them [<a
    id="x1-23005"
  ></a><a href="#cite.0@Ladisa2022">17</a>, <a id="x1-23006"></a><a href="#cite.0@Sejfia2022">29</a>,
  <a href="#cite.0@Zimmermann2019">34</a>]. We discussed that
  machine-learning-based systems can, with some confidence, flag malicious
  packages [<a href="#cite.0@Garrett2019">10</a>,
  <a href="#cite.0@Sejfia2022">29</a>] and that it is advisable to sandbox
  packages, like e.g. it is common practice with mobile apps [<a

  <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">node-ipc </span>incidents in the
  <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">npm</span> ecosystem, that recently gained
  attention because the maintainers themselves attacked their own OSS
  packages. We concluded that the
  <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">faker.js</span> incident does not suffice the
  criteria for being an SCA, but the
  <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">colors.js </span>and
  <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">node-ipc</span>
  incidents do so.
</p>
<!-- l. 13 -->
<p class="indent">
  We introduced the fundamentals of
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">trust </span>and
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">responsibility </span>in
  technology ethics and asked ourselves, whether a maintainer is responsible
  for the integrity of their package. We concluded, that a developer might
  not be responsible for actively maintaining his package, but if they do so
  or pretend to do so, they are in fact responsible for its integrity. We
  considered that the sense of responsibility a developer feels might be
  reduced by many factors, among others, by the temporal and/or physical
  distance between their actions and the resulting consequences, the
  anonymity on the internet, personal circumstances like stress, or
  hierarchical, economic, or time pressures [<a id="x1-23008"></a><a href="#cite.0@Bellovin2022">5</a>, <a id="x1-23009"></a><a href="#cite.0@Noorman2020">21</a>]. Furthermore, we discussed if it is
  rational to trust OSS. We saw that trusting OSS means trusting
  contributors and especially its maintainers to act responsibly. Therefore
  such a trust cannot be
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">well-grounded</span>, but it
  can be <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">plausible </span>and
  sometimes even
  <span class="LinLibertineTI-tlf-t1-x-x-120">justified</span>. We,
  therefore, concluded that it can be rational to trust OSS, but one cannot
  do so blindly and needs to consider each package individually.
</p>
<!-- l. 18 -->
<p class="indent">
  We then returned to the recent incidents and analyzed if the behavior of
  the maintainers is morally acceptable. We concluded, that it is morally
  acceptable to just stop maintaining a package and it might even be
  acceptable to completely delete the package, as was done in the
  <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">faker.js </span>incident. However, the
  behavior of the maintainers in the
  <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">colors.js </span>and
  <span class="fvmr8t-x-x-93">node-ipc</span>
  incidents is not morally acceptable. While their circumstances and motives
  might be quite relatable, they do not justify the attacks, that affected
  many (mostly) innocent people.
</p>
<!-- l. 22 -->
<p class="indent">
  We finally drew the conclusion, that one should apply SCA mitigation
  strategies. One should also consider if one needs to introduce a new
  dependency even for small tasks, and be cautious with the auto-updating
  functionalities of dependency managers. Furthermore as a user of OSS
  packages, one should consider donating to the mostly unsalaried volunteers
  maintaining them.
